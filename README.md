# CONTOLS FOR PHYSICS ENGINE
### I have always been fascinated by space, and with this being my first real 3d project I believe it turned out great, there was lots of time spent debugging, but I learned alot
#### this program simulates gravitation pull between multiple objects (you might notice some 3 body problems when you refres where because of the floas you get crazy new orbital paths {this is rare though!!!})

all the control schemes to explore my physics engine

## PROGRAM CONTROLS
### **RIGHT MOUSE CLICK** - hold to look around inside the window
### **ESCAPE** - unLocks the mouse to the window
## CAMERA MOVEMENT 
### **W** - moves the camera forward
### **A** - strafes the camera left

### **D** - strafes the camera right
### **SPACE** - moves the camera upward
### **LEFT CONTROL** - moves the camera downward
## MISC
### **Q** - toggles pause
### **1** - toggles pyramid of mass 500 
### **2** - toggles cube of mass 1000 
### **3** - toggles sphere of mass 3000 
### **R** - resets all planets to original position
### **E** - clears and deletes all planets
### **up** - increases spawn distance
### **down** - decreases spawn distance

## DEBUG MODE (meant for tuning values)
### **~** - toggles debug mode
### **up** - increases warp sharpness
### **down** - decreases warp sharpness
